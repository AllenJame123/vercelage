# Age-O-Matic Server-Side Rendering Migration Plan

## Background and Motivation
The Age-O-Matic website currently uses React with some SSR capabilities through `vite-plugin-ssr`, but it's not fully optimized for SEO. The codebase includes 8 calculator pages (`Index`, `Difference`, `DateCalculator`, `BirthdayCountdown`, `PregnancyCalculator`, `LeapYearCalculator`, `Retirement`, and `GenerationFinder`). We need a more comprehensive server-side rendering approach to improve SEO and discoverability on search engines.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. **Current Setup Analysis**: The app already has some SSR capabilities with `vite-plugin-ssr` and uses React Router for navigation. It includes `entry-server.tsx` and has a Netlify deployment configuration that routes through a server function.
2. **Framework Selection**: Choosing between Next.js and Remix for optimal Netlify deployment while maintaining current functionality.
3. **Component Migration**: Moving current React components to the selected framework without losing functionality.
4. **SEO Enhancement**: Building upon current SEO implementation in page components to make it more comprehensive.
5. **Data Flow Adaptation**: Adapting client-side calculations to work with server components where appropriate.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring the new SSR implementation maintains or improves performance.
7. **Styling Preservation**: Maintaining the current design system (using Shadcn UI with Tailwind CSS).

## High-level Task Breakdown

5. *Build Blocker: Netlify/CI Build Fails Before Dependency Installation*
   - *Error: /opt/build-bin/run-build-functions.sh: line XX: mkdir: command not found, touch: command not found, mise: command not found, Error setting python version from 3.13, Failing build: Failed to install dependencies.*
   - *Analysis: The build environment is missing basic Unix utilities (mkdir, touch), which is highly unusual for a standard CI/CD environment. The error with mise and Python versioning suggests a misconfigured or missing environment manager. The build fails before reaching project dependency installation.*
   - *Assistance Request: Is this a Netlify build, or are you running this in a custom CI/CD environment? Please clarify so I can suggest the most appropriate fix.*

*Blocker: Netlify deployment fails with Runtime.ImportModuleError for @remix-run/netlify, despite being present in package.json and netlify.toml configured for external_node_modules. Cleared build cache and redeployed, but issue persists.*

*Next steps:*
1. Review Netlify build logs for errors/warnings about dependency installation.
2. Try moving @remix-run/netlify to devDependencies and redeploy.
3. Remove external_node_modules from netlify.toml to force bundling all node modules, then redeploy.

*Awaiting user confirmation to proceed with these steps or for further instructions.*
